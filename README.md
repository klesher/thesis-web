********* NOTE *********

**This Astronomy Observation Language PHP XML parser & web site is by no means production ready at this time.**  
Many of these files contain passwords in clear text as this has only ever been deployed in a development environment for research purposes for my master's thesis.  

There has been no security testing, performance testing, hardening, etc. performed at this time, so **proceed at your own risk** if you choose not to heed the warnings of these obvious security flaws.
